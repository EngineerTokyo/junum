Git is an essential tool for software development, providing version control that allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project. While Git is powerful, getting started on Windows can feel intimidating if you’re new to it. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to set up and use Git on Windows, from installation to basic commands, so you can manage your projects efficiently.

Why Use Git?
Git offers several benefits, including:

Version Control: Track every change in your project history, enabling you to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Collaboration: Work with other developers seamlessly, whether on small teams or large open-source projects.
Branching and Merging: Create separate branches for features or bug fixes, which you can merge into the main project once complete.
Step 1: Install Git on Windows
To start using Git on Windows, you’ll need to install it:

Download Git: Go to the official Git website and download the latest Git for Windows installer.
Run the Installer: Open the downloaded installer file. During installation, you’ll be prompted to select options such as a default editor and environment preferences. If you’re new to Git, it’s generally safe to go with the default settings.
Verify Installation: Open the Command Prompt (search for “cmd” in the Start menu), and type:
   git --version
This command should return the installed Git version, confirming a successful installation.

Step 2: Configure Git on Windows
After installation, you need to configure Git with your identity so that your commits are associated with your name and email:

Set Your Username:
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Set Your Email:
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
These settings will apply to all Git repositories on your system. To set project-specific settings, omit the --global flag.

Step 3: Create a Git Repository
You can now create a Git repository to start tracking a project:

Open Command Prompt: Navigate to the folder where you want to create the repository.
Initialize a Repository:
   git init
This command will create a .git folder, indicating that Git is now tracking this project.

Step 4: Basic Git Commands
Here are some essential Git commands to start working with your repository:

1. Checking Repository Status
The git status command shows the current status of your working directory, including tracked, untracked, modified, or staged files:

git status
2. Adding Files to Staging
Before committing changes, you need to add files to the staging area using git add. This command prepares files for the next commit:

To add a specific file:
  git add filename.txt
To add all modified files:
  git add .
3. Committing Changes
The git commit command captures the changes in the staged files. Each commit should include a meaningful message describing what was done:

git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
4. Viewing Commit History
To view the history of commits, use:

git log
For a simplified log, use:

git log --oneline
Step 5: Working with Branches
Branches allow you to work on features or bug fixes separately from the main codebase:

Creating a New Branch:
   git branch branch-name
Switching to a Branch:
   git checkout branch-name
